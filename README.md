# Plane Programming
This repository contains my solution to [Challenge 1]((https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/challenge-1-steer-a-plane-through-obstacles-in-the-sky?projectId=5caccdfbedbc2a3cef0efe63&tab=overview&uv=2020.3#)) in the [Unity Junior Programmer Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer). 

### Challenge: Design a unity program that enables players to fly a plane around obstacles.

- Player input (up/down/forward/backward) should navigate the plane (up/down/forward/backward).
- The plane should move forward at a constant rate
- The camera should follow along beside the plane as it flies
- Create a script that spins the planeâ€™s propeller
